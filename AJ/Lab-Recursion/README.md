# Lab: Writing a Factorial Method using Recursion
## Factorial
## Background
Recall that a recursive method is one that calls itself (or a method with the same name). It effectively places a call to itself on the stack of execution.

Typically recursive methods have a base case and the recursive call (the statement that calls itself).

## Instructions
In this lab we'll explore writing an algorithm to compute the Fibonacci sequence of the nth value, where n is a specified parameter.

## Project Setup
Open your IDE (Eclipse), and select File > New > Java Project.
Provide the name, Lab-Recursion and click OK.
Right-click on the newly created project and select New > Class
Provide the name Fib for your class. .
Edit its contents so that it resembles the following
public class Fib {

    public int fibonacci(int n){

    }
}
Let's review the pseudocode for fibonacci.

func fib:

 input: x - the position of the fibonacci number
 output: the fibonacci number at position x

 if ( x == 0 ) return 0
 if ( x == 1 ) return 1

return fibonacci(x-1) + fibonacci(x-2)
Reading from the pseudocode, we'll need a method that defines an int parameter and returns an int. Reviewing our code so far it seems that we're on track.

Now we need to define the base case. In this algorithm we actually have two. If the position is 0, then we'll return 0. If the position is 1, then we'll return 1.

So let's write those in:

public class Fib {

    public int fibonacci(int n){

        if (n == 0) return 0;
        if (n == 1) return 1;
    }
}
Now we need to write the recursive step. Looking at the pseudocode we have to return the addition of two numbers. Let's try to write it all in one line just like the pseudocode as opposed to storing the values separately and then summing them and returning that result.

public class Fib {

    public int fibonacci(int n){

        if (n == 0) return 0;
        if (n == 1) return 1;

        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);
    }
}
It's pretty straightforward, huh?

Now it's time to test your solution. Create a class TestFib and a main method. Then update the class to create an instance of Fib and call the fibonacci method on different values, print them to the console and verify (visually) that you received the correct number.

You'll see output like the following:



This concludes the lab.

# Lab: Recursive Algorithms
## Writing Recursive Algorithms
## Objectives
Explore how to write an algorithm that is recursive.
## Background
Recall that a recursive algorithm is one that "calls itself" or "a method with the same name". In terms of methods, you'll write one and inside of that  method you'll call the same method. The trick is that the inner call to the method will be on a data set that is smaller and thus eventually it will end successive calls and not make an infinite stack of calls to the same method over and over again.

## Guided Practice
Follow the instructions below to setup a sample project to practice writing a recursive method. 

## Project Setup
Open your IDE (Eclipse), and select File > New > Java Project.

Provide the name, Lab-Recursion and click OK.

Right-click on the newly created project and select New > Class.

Provide the class the name, ExampleOne and click OK.

Now edit the file so that it looks like the following:

public class ExampleOne {

    public static void main(String\[\] args) {
        //create some dummy data for our method

        //call your methods here
    }

    //create your first method here
}
So let's create a recursive algorithm for calculating the factorial of a number. Recall that a factorial or N! is calculated as the sum of n * (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3),.. * (n-(n-1)). The calculation easily lends itself to a recursive function because you can simply multiply the number with one less than it until you reach the value of 1.

So let's create a public method that returns a whole number (int), is called factorial, and can accept a single int parameter.

The method signature will be thus:

public int factorial(int num)
When writing recursive functions we should think about a base case or cases. What input would return a value directly as opposed to generating another call to the recursive function? Well, 1 (one) is one such value. If someone wants the factorial of 1, we simply return 1. This is our base case.

For fullness, we can error-proof our method to also return a value in case someone passed in zero or less (since both are valid int values). In that case we can also add a base case if the parameter is zero or less.

NOTE: In conventional mathematics 0! is 1 and negative numbers are not calculated in the factorial equation. We'll simply return 0 in our method. 

Adding the base cases, our method would resemble such:

public int factorial (int num) {
    if (num <= 0) return 0;
    if (num == 1) return 1;

}
Great! So that takes care of our base case. Now we should focus on the recursive call. Thinking back to the definition of factorial, it is n * (n-1) * (n-2) * â€¦ (n - (n - 1)). The last case would equal one, which is our base case. So we need to multiple the current number, n, by one less than it (and the corresponding consecutive numbers). We can think of the chain as a call to our function, factorial, but passing in one less than the current number. Since 5! = 5 * 4!, 4! = 4 * 3! and so on. 

Thus our recursive call can be written as such:

return num \* factorial(num-1);
So now, our entire function would resemble:

public int factorial (int num) {
    if (num <= 0) return 0;
    if (num == 1) return 1;

    return num \* factorial(num-1);

}
Save your file and let's test the solution by invoking a call to factorial with some input. You can follow our example below:

public class ExampleOne {

    public static void main(String\[\] args) {
        //create some dummy data for our method
        int input = 5;

        ExampleOne eo = new ExampleOne();

        //call the method here
        System.out.println(eo.factorial(input));
    }

    //create your first method here
    public int factorial(int num) {
        if (num <= 0) return 0;
        if (num == 1) return 1;

        return num * factorial(num-1);
    }
}
Save your file and execute your code. You should have output that is the factorial of your input:



Congratulations! You have written a recursive method.

This concludes the lab.
